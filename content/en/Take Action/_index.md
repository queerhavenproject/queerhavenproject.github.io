## Your Action Matters

<style>li {text-align: left}</style>

### Practical Actions that Ottawa can Take
1. Include in the 10-year Ottawa Housing Plan an effort to address the unique needs of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by funding an LGBTQ+ emergency shelter <br><br>
2. Create a mandatory standard for emergency shelters that employees must be trained in supporting 2SLGBTQIA+ community <br><br>
3. Increase presence of 2SLGBTQIA+ persons in conversations about their needs by funding a leadership coalition in Ottawa <br><br>
4. Improve data collection on 2SLGBTQIA+ communities <br><br>
5. Address the continuation of discrimination against 2SLGBTQIA+ community regarding housing and shelter access <br><br>


### How Ottawa can use the United Nations Human Rights Declaration for Change for 2SLGBTQIA+ Individuals: 
- Protect LGBTQIA+ persons from violence: Ottawa can support this by creating a safe shelter that will directly impact our 2SLGBTQIA+ unhoused population <br><br>
- Safeguard freedoms of expression: By developing gender-sensitive shelters and environments, it will allow our vulnerable and unhoused population to be free to express their identity and as a result be able to have their needs met <br><br>
