## Your Action Matters - Support Safe Shelter Access

## The Evidence is Clear
- Research shows that 2SLGBTQIA+ adults in Ottawa face significant barriers when accessing emergency shelter and housing services: Between 5-30% of adults experiencing homelessness identify as 2SLGBTQIA+
- 29% of trans people report being turned away from shelters
- 3/4 of the community member respondents identified housing and homelessness as a critical priority for the 2SLGBTQIA+ community

Despite multiple reports and recommendations over the years highlighting these critical gaps.
We have yet to see meaningful action or concrete plans from the City of Ottawa to address these systemic barriers or create dedicated safe spaces for 2SLGBTQIA+ adults experiencing homelessness.


## Our Call to Action
1. Include in the 10-year Ottawa Housing Plan an effort to address the unique needs of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by funding an LGBTQ+ emergency shelter <br><br>
2. Create a mandatory standard for emergency shelters that employees must be trained in supporting 2SLGBTQIA+ community<br><br>
3. Increase presence of 2SLGBTQIA+ persons in conversations about their needs by funding a leadership coalition in Ottawa<br><br>
4. Improve data collection on 2SLGBTQIA+ communities<br><br>
5. Address the continuation of discrimination against 2SLGBTQIA+ community regarding housing and shelter access<br><br>
