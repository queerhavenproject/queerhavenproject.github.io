## Your Action Matters

### Practical Actions that Ottawa can Take
1. Include in the 10-year Ottawa Housing Plan an effort to address the unique needs of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by funding an LGBTQ+ emergency shelter
1. Create a mandatory standard for emergency shelters that employees must be trained in supporting 2SLGBTQIA+ community
1. Increase presence of 2SLGBTQIA+ persons in conversations about their needs by funding a leadership coalition in Ottawa
1. Improve data collection on 2SLGBTQIA+ communities 
Address the continuation of discrimination against 2SLGBTQIA+ community regarding housing and shelter access 

How Ottawa can use the United Nations Human Rights for 2SLGBTQIA+ to create change: 
- Protect LGBTQ+ persons from violence: Ottawa can make moves towards this by creating a safe shelter that will directly impact our 2SLGBTQIA+ unhoused population 
- Safeguard freedoms of expression: By creating a safe shelter and environment it allows our vulnerable unhoused population to be free to express their identity and their needs
