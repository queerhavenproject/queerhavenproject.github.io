## What is the Ottawa Queer Haven Project?

The Ottawa Queer Haven Project is a call to action addressing the urgent need for inclusive, accessible, and safe housing services for 2SLGBTQIA+ adults experiencing homelessness in Ottawa. Through existing research and literature, we highlight critical service gaps and advocate for systemic change at policy, municipal, and service delivery levels.

## Who We Are
We are two students in the master of social work program at Carleton University. We have witnessed first-hand the gaps in the Ottawa homelessness sector through direct service work. Through our experiences and reviewing current research, there is a clear urgent need for change for services supporting 2SLGBTQIA+ adults facing homelessness.
