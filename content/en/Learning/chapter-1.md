Please check out key information below highlighting the inequities 2SLGBTQIA+ indivduals experience while homeless: 

* 119,000 People identified as LGBTQ+ and were experiencing homelessness in 2023
* 77.9% of LGBTQ+ persons experiencing homelessness have experienced criminal victimization
* There has been a 69% increase in violence towards LGBTQ+ people in 2023
* Research found that most LGBTQ+ persons stated they felt unsafe accessing emergency shelters in Ottawa
* There are not any services that address adult LGBTQ+ homelessness in Ottawa
* There is only 1 emergency shelter that requires workers to do training in wokring with the LGBTQ+ community
* 90% of asylum seekers who are LGBTQ+ are successful and yet 1 organization in Ontario services their unique needs
* Â¾ of people in the LGBTQ+ community surveyed want Ottawa to address LGBTQ+ experiences of homelessness

Additional Considerations: 
  * The true rates may be underreported due to:
   * Need to conceal identity for safety
   * Limited data collection on gender/sexual identity
   * Prevalence of hidden homelessness
   * Barriers to accessing shelters due to discrimination
