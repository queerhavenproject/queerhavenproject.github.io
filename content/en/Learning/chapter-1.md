Please check out key information below highlighting the inequities 2SLGBTQIA+ indivduals experience while homeless: 

<!--more-->

* 119,000 People identified as LGBTQ+ and were experiencing homelessness in 2023[^1]
* 77.9% of LGBTQ+ persons experiencing homelessness have experienced criminal victimization[^7]
* There has been a 69% increase in violence towards LGBTQ+ people in 2023[^3]
* Research found that most LGBTQ+ persons stated they felt unsafe accessing emergency shelters in Ottawa[^5][^6]
* There are not any services that address adult LGBTQ+ homelessness in Ottawa
* There is only 1 identified emergency shelter that requires workers to complete specialized LGBTQ+ training 
* 90% of asylum seekers who are LGBTQ+ are successful, with only one organization in Ontario that has the resources to meet their needs[^2]
* Â¾ of people in the LGBTQ+ community surveyed want Ottawa to address LGBTQ+ experiences of homelessness[^4]

Additional Considerations: 
The true rates may be underreported due to:
   * Need to conceal identity for safety
   * Limited data collection on gender/sexual identity
   * Prevalence of hidden homelessness
   * Barriers to accessing shelters due to discrimination
