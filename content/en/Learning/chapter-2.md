### Summary of findings from pre-existing research 

#### Gaps identified for Ottawa’s LGBTQ+ community: 

In September 2020 the City of Ottawa asked citizens to engage in their community safety and wellbeing research. Out of the 709 respondents, the following points were found: 
 - 28% of respondents spoke of the priority of the city of ottawa focusing on the issue of discrimination/marginalization towards LGBTQ individuals due to the continued prevalence of violence  
 - 18.94% of people also stated that addressing housing/homelessness was a priority for the LGBTQ community to create safer shelter options, inclusive housing, and anti-discrimination in attaining housing 

In 2023 the Wisdom2Action call to action found that: 
 - 2SLGBTQ+ individuals often experienced discrimination from fellow service users, fear coming out as 2SLGBTQ+ in shelter spaces, and housing services not having sufficient training on 2SLGBTQ+ inclusion 
 - There is a lack of social and community spaces, groups and events for LGBTQ+ communities to feel safe and visible in. Existing organizations are significantly underfunded and do not meet all the needs of the community 
- Community members and organizations are often unaware of the limited resources and programs available and are unsure if and where they can access services that meet their needs 

The Daybreak Non-Profit Housing in Ottawa recently carried out a study of the housing and support needs of 2SLGBTQIA+ adults who have experienced homelessness. The study concluded that: 
 - Many of the participants did not feel safe disclosing their gender identity and/or sexual orientation with other clients. This discomfort arose from the potential of verbal and physical harassment from the other clients. 
 - Over half of the participants stated that they would access housing specific to the LGBTQ2S community. 
 - Regardless of the type of housing that is potentially developed, participants thought it was important to include support for those who needed it and to staff the housing with individuals who identify as part of the LGBTQ2S community. 

The Canadian social research and demonstration corporation found that the lack of funding and resources for queer serving persons eg, shelter policies may exclude LGBT and being unhoused makes it difficult to get gender affirming care 

- In a 2021 77.9% of 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness report experiencing criminal victimization (e.g. theft, sexual assault) (learning network)
  
Community Housing Canada found that LGBTQ2 people—and trans people specifically—experience discrimination in accessing emergency shelters and temporary housing.
