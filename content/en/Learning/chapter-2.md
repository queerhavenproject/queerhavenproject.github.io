### Summary of Findings from Recent Research 

#### Service Gaps Identified for the 2SLGBTQIA+ Homeless Community

In September 2020 the City of Ottawa asked citizens to engage in their community safety and wellbeing research [^1]. Out of the 709 respondents, the following points were found: 
 - 28% of respondents spoke of the priority of the city of ottawa focusing on the issue of discrimination/marginalization towards LGBTQ individuals due to the continued prevalence of violence  
 - Nearly one-fifth (18.94%) of respondents identified housing and homelessness as a critical priority for the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, specifically highlighting the need for: safe and inclusive emergency shelter options, accessible housing programs, protection against housing discrimination and affordable housing solutions

In 2023 the Wisdom2Action call to action report found that [^2]: 
 - 2SLGBTQ+ individuals often experienced discrimination from fellow service users, fear coming out as 2SLGBTQ+ in shelter spaces, and housing services not having sufficient training on 2SLGBTQ+ inclusion 
 - There is a lack of social and community spaces, groups and events for LGBTQ+ communities to feel safe and visible in
 - Limited access to mental health and addiction services despite higher rates of need
 -  Existing organizations are significantly underfunded and are unable meet all the needs of the community 
- Community members and organizations are often unaware of the resources and programs available and may not know where and how to access services that meet their needs 

The Daybreak Non-Profit Housing carried out a study in 2017 of the housing and support needs of 2SLGBTQIA+ adults who have experienced homelessness [^3]. The study presented that: 
 - 29% of trans people reported being turned away from shelters
 - Many of the participants did not feel safe disclosing their gender identity and/or sexual orientation with other clients. This discomfort arose from the potential of verbal and physical harassment from the other clients.
 - Only 15% of service providers thought LGBTQ2S clients were treated well by other clients
 - Over half of the participants stated that they would access housing specific to the LGBTQ2S community. 
 - Regardless of the type of possible housing developments, participants shared of having staff including individuals who identify as part of the LGBTQ2S community. 

The Canadian Social Research and Demonstration Corporation found that [^4]:
- the lack of funding and resources for queer persons and shelter policies may exclude LGBT individuals
-  Homelessness adds to the challenges to recieve gender-affirming care 

In a 2021 77.9% of 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness report experiencing criminal victimization [^5]
  
Community Housing Canada found that LGBTQ2 people—and trans people specifically—experience discrimination in accessing emergency shelters and temporary housing [^6].
