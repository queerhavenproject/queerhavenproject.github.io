### Promising Approaches in Action

Ottawa can utilize the example of Torontoâ€™s 2SLGBTQIA+ shelter for refugees as a template for meeting Ottawa's needs. 

519 Shelter meets the needs of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by: [^1] 
 
- Works with the city to create specific training by LGBTQ+ community that addresses the needs and how to deliver services that are meaningful LGBTQ+ clients 
- Creating a safe shelter space that prioritizes LGBTQ+ and specifically trans, gender diverse, and non-binary persons 
Supporting clients beyond their time in the program to support stabilization and connection to community 
- Focusing on providing resources and education that support the LGBTQ+ community, staff, and/or the general population
